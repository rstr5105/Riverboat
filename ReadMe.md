## 1. Game Overview

----------



Project Riverboat is a 2D top down scrolling shooter where in the player controls a warship traveling along a scrolling river to defeat enemy forces.  Each enemy destroyed will drop [insert game currency here] which can be used to purchase upgraded weapons, armor, and ship hulls from the in game "store".

Each level in riverboat will consist of a statically generated river and statically generated level types (eg. Desert, Forest, City, etc) but the bulk of map and enemy generation will be dynamic.  (Why? Because who doesn't like dynamism?)  This will provide the player with a greater level of replayability.


###1A. Mechanics:
The mechanics of riverboat will be fairly simple. 

Controls will consist of a single virtual thumbstick which will control the player's targeting system, and another one on the opposite side to control ship movement.  Aiming will consist of a targeting cross-hair and a damage area indicator.  To damage/destroy an enemy they must be within the damage area indicator when the round hits.

Extra points will be rewarded for both direct hit and kill chains.  Kill chains are earned by not letting any enemy unit or emplacement leave the screen undestroyed.

###2A. World Generation
Each level will consist of a statically generated river at least X number of pixels wide.  The world around this river will consist of empty space, which will be filled in by the engine based on what type of level it is.  

###2B. Enemies
At the start of each level, enemy squadrons and emplacements will be generated dynamically within a fixed range of possibilities and types.  Therefore the player can know what types of enemies to expect on a given map, and an overall difficulty rating but never exactly how many, and what types of enemies will appear where or when on the map.  Again this is to produce a higher replayablity factor.  

###2C. Missions
Missions will be divided between two categories.  Primary Missions, and Bonus Missions.  For each map the player plays the primary mission list will always include a set number (usually one or two) missions, I.E. Destroy Boss, Stay Alive etc.  Bonus missions will be generated at the map select screen and will include things like Destroy x% of the maps enemies or Stay above H% health.  Failing to complete a Primary Mission will result in map failure, however failure to complete a bonus mission will only result in the loss of gaining the points that the bonus mission would have provided.  Ergo, there is no real penalty for failing to complete a bonus mission, but completing the the bonus missions for a level will result in additional points or items for the successful player.      

###2D Achievements
Project Riverboat will include both Achievements and Unchievements.  

Achievements will be of the standard style, i.e complete the first map, destroy a certain number of enemies etc, etc, etc.  

Unchievements will be rewarded based on things that would normally be considered bad things, i.e., die 100 times on the first map.  Fail to beat the first boss on your first run etc etc.

Project Riverboat will strive to use 16bit SNES style graphics as much as possible both for nostalgia purposes and for ease of art creation.
